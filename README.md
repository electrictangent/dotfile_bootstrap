# Dotfiles Bootstrap

This repo contains my dotfiles. Comes with an almost automatic installer script.

For Arch based systems. Suited for fresh installs.

## Usage
Use `install.sh <new-user>` to install the dotfiles to a new user.

Use `config_copy.sh <current-user>` to install the dotfiles to an existing user.

You must add your own mouse cursor and GTK3 themes to `.icons/` and `.themes/` respectively.


## To do
- Add package list to seperate file

## Misc
Windows startup/shutdown sounds from Microsoft.
